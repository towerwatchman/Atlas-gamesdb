                        system was conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins.</p>

                        public in April 1977. The Apple II started the boom in personal computer sales in the late
                        1970s, and pushed Apple into the lead among personal computer makers.</p>

                        Mattel did not start by designing a computer. It instead began by looking around for a pre-made
                        computer system it could market under its name. It discovered that one of its manufacturing
                        partners, the Hong Kong based Radofin Electronics Far East, had already designed a three-system
                        line of home computers. All Mattel had to do was secure the U.S. marketing rights, which it
                        promptly did for the first two units in the line, and have Radofin handle the manufacturing.</p>

                    <p>Featuring a 4MHz Z80A-compatible processor and a 640x200-pixel, 8-color display, the PC-8801 was
                        twice as fast as the PC-8001, with eight times as many pixels and up to four times as much RAM.
                        However, the biggest selling point was its backwards compatibility with PC-8001 software,
                        providing a smooth upgrade path for customers who had already bought into the NEC ecosystem.
                        Games were not the primary focus, as NEC intended to sell its high-end 8-bit machine to a whole

                        units had been sold. The first model, the PC-9801, was launched on October 1982, and employed an
                        8086 CPU. It ran at a clock speed of 5 MHz, with two ÂµPD7220 display controllers (one for text,

                        international markets. It is the successor of the Game Boy. The Game Boy Color, as suggested by
                        the name, features a color screen, but no backlight. It is slightly thicker and taller than the
                        Game Boy Pocket, which is a redesigned Game Boy released in 1996. As with the original Game Boy,
                        it has a custom 8-bit processor somewhat related to a Zilog Z80 central processing unit (CPU).

                    <h3>Nintendo GameCube</h3>
                    <p>The Nintendo GameCube was the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage
                        medium. In contrast with the GameCube's contemporary competitors, Sony's PlayStation 2, Sega's
                        Dreamcast and Microsoft's Xbox, the GameCube uses mini DVD-based discs instead of full-size
                        DVDs. Partially as a result of this, it does not have the DVD-Video playback functionality of
                        these systems, nor the audio CD playback ability of other consoles that use full-size optical
                        discs.</p>

                    <p>The PokÃ©mon Mini is a handheld game console that was designed and manufactured by Nintendo and
                        themed around the PokÃ©mon media franchise. It is the smallest game system with interchangeable
                        cartridges ever produced by Nintendo, weighing just under two and a half ounces (70 grams). It
                        was first released in North America on November 16, 2001, then in Japan on December 14, 2001,
                        and in Europe on March 15, 2002. The systems were released in three colors: Wooper Blue,
                        Chikorita Green, and Smoochum Purple. Features of the PokÃ©mon mini include an internal real-time
                        clock, an infrared port used to...</p>

                    <p>The Satellaview is a satellite modem peripheral for Nintendo's Super Famicom system that was
                        released in Japan in 1995. Available for pre-release orders beginning February 13, 1995, the
                        Satellaview retailed for between Â¥14,000 and 18,000 (at the time between USD$141 and 182) and
                        came bundled with the BS-X Game Pak and an 8M Memory Pak. The Satellaview system was developed
                        and released by Nintendo to receive signals broadcast from satellite TV station WOWOW's
                        satellite radio subsidiary, St.GIGA. St.GIGA was responsible for file server management,
                        maintenance, and vocalization for "SoundLink"...</p>
